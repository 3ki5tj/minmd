## Overview

We use cmake as our building system

## CMake

### Installing cmake

On Ubuntu, we can install cmake by typing
```
sudo apt install cmake
```

### Building the project

Under the project root directory, where this file is located

```
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

After the binaries are successfully build, the `md` program is located under `build/src/programs/md`
