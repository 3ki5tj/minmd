# MinMD

A minimalist molecular dynamics (MD) simulation package.

## Overview

We wish to write a minimalist and yet self-contained molecular dynamics code.
We hope that such a minimal codebase would help students under key aspect of various MD algorithms.

## Installation

Quick way of building the system:
```
make
```
See INSTALL for more details.

NOTE: the Makefiles under the `src` directory are dummy files.
They are used only to clean up the source code, instead of building the software.
